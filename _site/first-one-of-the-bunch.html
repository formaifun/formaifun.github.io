<p>Is there a better time to start a blog or any new venture than New years? I bet that any time is better. As long as there is a start. So here’s mine.</p>

<p>As 2018 came to an end I, as majority of people do, found myself reflecting on the past year, but my mind took me even further, deeper to all the years I’ve lived on this Earth as myself. I want to bend my mind and abilities this year as I’ve never done before. Actually implementing that famous quote about “Nothing will change in your life, if you don’t do something different from what you’ve been doing”. Personally the biggest challenge for me is putting myself out there and keeping in touch with people. That are the things I’ve never done before properly and I want to change it this year. “New year- New me” style. I have no idea where it will take me. I might fail miserably. I might not stick to my words, but I might persevere. I want changes in my life and I’m open for failure, at least now.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love my life as it is, yet I want to make it even better. There’s no limit to perfection, right? Also, something else I’m doing differently this year is putting my intentions for the world to see and judge. I was never a big believer that accountability to other people in the public/social media actually works. Now I’ll know for sure as we will see results at the end of 2019.</p>

<p>Briefly reviewing my 2018 life, here is a list of my favourite things in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I had the first road trip through Ukraine with my younger brother without parents. I don’t remember that we ever travelled independently. It was a special time for me. I’m working on having more trips with him in the future.

  <li>Climbing the tallest mountain in Ukraine for the first time in my life. Mountain Hoverla was something of a dream. It is not easy to get to start of the trails and the trails turned out to be harder than I initially thought. Also, it was very cold at the top.

  <li>The way my love partner welcomed me home from a business trip during Halloween. As I was sad to miss out on the holiday yet again. he decorated the hole flat and we had our own private mini-halloween party.

  <li>Spending the most time I’ve ever spent in a year with my cat. I love him so incredibly much. If it wasn’t  for him I might never wanna put travelling on pause.

  <li>Learning to do my own manicure and pedicure with gel polish. Manicure makes me happier and I don’t usually wear plain coloured nails.Now I can finally do it myself when and where I want to.</li>
  <li>All the bold transformations I’ve had just for fun for the first time in my life. Including, but not limiting to making a ‘real’ unicorn hair-horn, reindeer makeup, transformed into a witch and so on. Even bigger achievement was me going places and doing live streams looking like all the different characters.</li>
  <li>Arran 10 y.o. whiskey I tried on Whiskey Drum 2018 in Kyiv. The first ever whiskey that actually tasted as Pina Colada cocktail, but still being whiskey. It was an unbelievable experience. Didn’t buy the bottle yet. I have more than enough alcohol to last me for years already.

  <li>Cupcake Jemma’s chocolate cake recipe. Chocolate cakes are my favourite and I finally found the best no-sweat recipe. I like to add my own twist of ‘soaking’ the cake in homemade rum/whiskey syrup, it makes it even more moist and taste more complex. Original  recipe is &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ek8TD1H2s5Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</li>
  <li>The best two albums that came out in the last two years, in my opinion: Eminem’s Kamikaze and Black Eyed Peas’s Muster of the Sun vol.1. I’ve felt that real hip-hop had been really dead. As a child of the 90s I grew on the best hip-hop wave, in my opinion, so these two albums were such a treat!</li>

<p>I’ve fallen in love with travelling, cooking and drinking hard liquor like whiskey and rum relatively recently, so I want to embrace all of it more. Unfortunately, memory is easily flooded and amazing things get forgotten, thus I ought to make same mistakes over and over again… I don’t want this happening. I dislike scrapbooking, so that’s gonna be my more useable version of it.</p>

<p>You can expect reading and watching about travels, foods and drinks and other stuff i really like and/or find useful. No promises, though.</p>

<p>Let’s make 2019 the best year we’ve ever lived.</p>

<p>Cheers to that!</p>

<p>P.S. Ending of the Holiday season makes me happier than the Holiday season itself. It was a weird end to an weird year.</p>
