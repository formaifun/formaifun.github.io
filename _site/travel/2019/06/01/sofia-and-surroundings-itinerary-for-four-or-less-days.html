  <h2 id="list-of-things-to-do-in-sofia-with-practical-tips-visuals-and-maps"><em>List of things to do in Sofia with practical tips, visuals and maps!</em></h2>

<p>To read more about what I did in Bulgaria click here.
 If you are interested in more details of where did I stay and how much does it cost to enjoy Bulgaria click here.
To read about food and cultural impression of the country click here.</p>

<p>The history of the city of Sofia goes as far as II B.C. This city was destroyed and rebuilt countless times. Changed many names, we don’t even know them all. The name we know the city by comes after the St. Sofia Church. The legend has it that many years ago, in XIV-XVI century travelers would orient themselves to St. Sofia Church on top of the hill. Countless people went praying there as it was the biggest church at the time. They were asking for St. Sofia Church so often, that it just became Sofia and the city around it took this name.</p>

<p>Overall, Sofia is full of churches. So if you’re not interested in religious and architectural delights you might find it difficult to entertain yourself with cultural part of Sofia, in my opinion. It is, in general, especially hard to explore in winter months.</p>

<p>First of all, here are some warnings/tips that you may encounter and you should probably be prepared for.</p>

<ol>
  <li>As a non-smoking person with a sensitive nose I found it hard to breath sometimes even out on the streets as many locals go heavy on cigarettes. Moreover it’s allowed to smoke in public places including cafes and restaurants.</li>
  <li>To find really good place that serves true local food is pretty hard. Most of them are made for tourists. We found great local place you can read more about by clicking here.</li>
  <li>Walkways are pretty wretched especially in an old city center Serdica, they’re narrow and broken and covered in trash from time to time depending on where your feet get you.</li>
  <li>Weather gets really cold really fast. For winter, I would say, expect weather to be 10 C colder than you think/feel at the moment of going out.</li>
  <li>Free city tours are available and start at pedestrian zone of Vitosha boulevard.</li>
  <li>If you’re planning to go outside of Sofia arrange yourself a driver for a day or order taxi before hand. You can order a car to go from city to city with no problem for reasonable price. To read more about that click here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, one local said that in colder months city of Sofia is heated by burning logs… So here are my suggestions on what I did in Sofia. Just a warning why it’s so sparse: the weather was miserable and jet lag after intense NY and Christmas holidays was brutal.</p>

<h2 id="day-one-">**Day One **</h2>
<p><strong><em>what I actually managed to do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Starting from the Lion’s Bridge Metro Station where you can possibly take cute photos. [IMG_4716]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have breakfast at Hadjidraganov’s Houses Restaurant which is less than 5 mins walk from the station. Address: ul. “Kozloduy” 75. As it’s very well styled and food there is delicious, thus, it deserves to be listed as an ‘attraction’ important to visit. [IMG_0560]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a walk at Women’s Market aka Zhensky Pazar (женски пазар). It’s pretty eclectic little street with lots of locals to observe. Old architecture to admire and, maybe, get some souvenir shopping done.  A lot of handmade items sold here. Tip: at least try to negotiate price down. I noticed that prices there are a bit higher than in some other souvenir shops for the same items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pass beautiful Sofia Synagogue. If you would like to go inside it’s possible. Though, I don’t know for sure asit was enough for me to admire it outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the way to the main square you will most likely pass by Banya Bashi Mosque. The statue nearby looks like an angel in the dark from a side, if you walk from a metro station Serdica.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn down to see Saint Sofia Monument and surrounding buildings. You might actually see it from the previous location. I do recommend going closer to it and enjoy beautiful Independence Square (Nezavisimost square) surrounded by government buildings.  [IMG_5364,  IMG_5394, IMG_5392]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amphitheatre of Serdica is located right there as well. It’s underground where the Serdica metro station is. Surprisingly, it seems that not many people turn to take a walk there, but young locals like to rehearse dancing, singing, playing etc. there.  [IMG_5373, IMG_5382]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a walk to a ‘staple’ of Sofia - Alexandr Nevsky Cathedral. It’s probably the most known attraction of the country. You have to see it yourself. St. Sofia Church is basically right on the same square as well. [IMG_5457] [IMG_4069]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you still feel like walking some more, take a walk to National Stadium ‘Vasil Levsky’ through Eagle Bridge. If not, go straight to closest metro station of Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a metro ride to NDK and you’ll be on Vitosha Boulevard. There’re plenty of places to eat, have fun and shop. It seems that this is actually the place where all the cool locals go. [IMG_4700, IMG_4703]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="day-two-">**Day Two **</h2>
<p>** <em>what I wish I also visited in Sofia, but it’s left for the next time</em>**</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Church of St. George tucked away in the city center. It’s the oldest building in Sofia built in 4th century.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regional History Museum near Banya Bashi Mosque. Former public bath House turned into Museum. Exterior of it is very beautiful, right up my ally, and for a museum/gallery junkie it will be a delightful visit. I reckon, it has many exquisite costumes of the times and carriages on display that might fascinate younger audience. Foolproof times to visit are Tuesday-Sunday from 10:00 to 18:00. Entry fee is 8 lev for adults, concession price 2 lev.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a picnic in Borisova Gradina. This activity would be perfect in warmer months. Having a chill stroll and eating take away food in the oldest park in Sofia. According to photos it has beautiful landscaping, some hidden gems and, honestly, I have a thing for TV towers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Museum of History located on the outskirts on the way to Boyana Church is Bulgaria’s largest museum. About 30 collections are displayed there. It might take a whole day in itself, or, if you’re like me you can rush through it in couple of hours. It’s open (you can buy tickets) on average from 9:30 to 16:45. Last ticket is sold 45 min before closing. Entre fee is 10 lev, student price is 1 lev.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="day-three-">**Day Three **</h2>
<p><strong><em>hiking day</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m most excited to go inside Boyana Church. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site that has 89 scenes depicted on the walls of the church. It’s open from 9:30 to 17:00. It’s supposedly not a functioning church anymore. It functions as a museum with entrance fee of 10 lev. There’s a rumor that every Monday from 15:00 entry is free of charge. Souvenir coin is 4 lev.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boyana Waterfall is accessible only by foot from Boyana Church. Hike takes from 1,5 hours to 3 hours one way. On the way to trails there’s an information desk where you can have more detailed information on hike paths, conditions and other questions you might have. There might be shops open near Momina Skala past waterfall on the way to Golden Bridges, but it’s not guaranteed, better ask at info desk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Golden Bridges is a stone river on Vitosha Mountain. Perfect for a picnic it offers amazing views. I’ve never seen anything like this in person yet. There should be a cafe to replenish water and food supply. It takes about an hour of hiking to get there from Boyana Waterfall. Also, you can take a quicker route if you are starting from Golden Bridges by taking a car as high and as close to it as you can and hiking from the road for about 10-15 min to reach your destination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case you are savoring goin on top of Vitosha Mountain, go to Cherni Vruh  (2290 m high). It’s not the highest point in Bulgaria, but still it’s quite high and gets really cold even in Summer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="day-four-">**Day Four **</h2>
<p><strong><em>getting closer to nature</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve already been to Rila Monastery on a beautiful Winter day, but, I would like to revisit the Monastery without snow covering it’s domes and pathways. It’s free to enter. There are two entrances to the place. The Main one is usually crowded with tourist buses and the back one, which is smaller, but it seems that only private cars park there. We went through the back entrance and will do it again. There are cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops at Main entrance. Besides the Monastery itself you can visit History Museum for 8 lev; Tower of Hrelio, Ethnografic museum, Bulgarian renaissance guestrooms and Monastery farm for 5 lev. At Monastery’s bakery you can get a staple pastry of the Bulgarian cuisine - Motzis. They are only 0.5 lev each and definitely worth a wait in a line. [IMG_4121, IMG_4135, IMG_4105, IMG_5475]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hike around Rila National Park, especially around Seven Rila Lakes. It would be a nice to start by taking a lift up and spending 4 hours hiking, having picnics and pics. Fee for using a cabin lift of 18 lev both ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would wrap up my, possibly, perfect trip to Sofia and surrounding areas. It will be not the only trip to explore at least half of Bulgaria. I recon, two to three more trips will make more accurate and all-round better understanding of Bulgaria and  its people.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
